<!-- ABOUT THis PROJECT -->
## About This Project
All about enhancing the shopping experience. Understanding the importance of product suitability for a consumers space by harnessing Augmented Reality as a solution.

The project was served for publishing on Google's AdMob giving the target consumers to view both a 3D representation of the product and a seemless click-through to an AR experience on the device.


<br>

<i>Seeing is believing, and the aim is to help visualize how a product fits seamlessly into your space. No more guesswork ‚Äì effortlessly try different sizes and styles, finding the perfect fit for your needs.</i>
